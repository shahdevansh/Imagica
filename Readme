About Imagica:

Imagica is a visual aid for toddlers and differently-abled children to learn via images instead of language.
It is well known the vision is the best way to learn for children. We intend to help toddlers and challenged children learn better and faster through Images.
Thus, Imagica.
Our application, which is native python and can be ported to various platforms, converts whatever an instructor/parent/teacher says in English to a series or slideshow of images that would convey the same meaning. This is done is almost real-time.
Our algorithm uses various speech-to-text conversion, POS tagging, image search and filtering and kivy for Graphics design.

We have taken care of foul and abusive images and other related problems too.
Please feel free to suggest any improvements/changes.

And till then, continue to get surprized!

Note:
It started out as an real time conversion from speech to American Sign Language for those with hearing difficulties and can still be used to do that.
